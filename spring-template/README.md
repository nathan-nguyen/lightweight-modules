**Spring MVC** is a complete HTTP oriented MVC framework managed by the **Spring Framework** and based in Servlets. It would be equivalent to JSF in the JavaEE stack. The most popular elements in it are classes annotated with @Controller, where you implement methods you can access using different HTTP requests. It has an equivalent @RestController to implement REST based APIs.

**Spring boot** is a utility for setting up applications quickly, offering an out of the box configuration in order to build Spring powered applications. Spring integrates a wide range of different modules in its umbrella, as **spring-core**, **spring-data**, **spring-web** (which includes **Spring MVC**), etc... . With this tool, we can tell **Spring** how many of them to use and get a fast setup for them.

**Conclusion**: **Spring MVC** is a framework to be used in web applications and **Spring boot** is a Spring based production-ready project initializer.
