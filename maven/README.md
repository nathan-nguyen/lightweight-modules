**settings.xml** is your user preferences. It lives in your main Maven directory (usually $HOME/.m2) and holds your own settings, like listings for non-public repositories, usernames, and other personalized configuration.

There are two locations where a settings.xml file may live:

The Maven install: ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml

A userâ€™s install: ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml

The former settings.xml are also called global settings, the latter settings.xml are referred to as user settings. If both files exists, their contents gets merged, with the user-specific settings.xml being dominant.

**pom.xml** is the control file for each Maven project or module. It tells Maven which dependencies the project needs, what processing to apply to build it, and how to package it when it's ready. The POM is part of the project itself, and so information that's necessary to build the project (such as listing which plug-ins to use when building) should go there.
