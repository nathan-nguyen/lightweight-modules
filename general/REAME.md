# Scala basic knowledge

1. "Hello World" * n

--> New String with n times "Hello World", StringBuffer is behind the scenes.

2. for (_ <- 1 to n) // Do something

--> Loop [1,n]

3. object Solution extends App

--> All the statments contained in that object will be executed, otherwise method main needs to be added.
